        myVariable --; //this is also an statement
//        the whole line of code is the statement in java
        System.out.println("this is an test ");
//        the whole system call is a statement,
// and the println is also a method call

//        java dont care about white space at all
//        indenting is a way to read your code in a good manner
//        you can use the one space method vs indenting but that is your call
//        most people just indent the code
